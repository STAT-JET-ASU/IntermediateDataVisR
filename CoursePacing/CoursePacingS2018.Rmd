```{block, week1optional, type='rmdoptional'}
#### Optional {-}

You may want to install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [R](http://cran.r-project.org), [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), [zotero](https://www.zotero.org), and optionally [$LaTeX$](http://www.ctan.org/starter) on your personal computer. If you do, you will want to follow Jenny Bryan's excellent advice for [installing R and RStudio](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) and [installing Git](http://stat545-ubc.github.io/git01_git-install.html).  Jenny's advice is also in chapters 6 and 7 of _[Happy Git and GitHub for the useR]_(http://happygitwithr.com/).  Note that [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [R](http://cran.r-project.org), [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), and [$LaTeX$](http://www.ctan.org/starter) are all installed on the [Appstate RStudio](https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/) server.

Watch the following videos as appropriate:

* [Install R on Mac (2 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJxVRgiX-ik)
