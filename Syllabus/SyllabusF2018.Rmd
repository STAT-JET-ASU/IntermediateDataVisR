**Instructor:**    Dr. Jill E. Thomley  
**E-Mail:**        thomleyje@appstate.edu  
**Office:**        Walker Hall 228  
**Office Hours:**  see [My Schedule](https://jillthomley.github.io/schedule.html)

I will use the Course Announcements forum on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/) to send out announcements and course information. You are responsible for knowing the content of all postings, in addition to anything I say in class. Except for emergencies, all written communication should be handled through your Private Forum on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). I prefer this method because it stores all exchanges in a place where we can easily access them and it keeps my class communications separate from the rest of my email.

You can [book me online](https://thomleyje.youcanbook.me/) for an appointment during office hours.


**Course Description:**  

This course expands on the student's existing knowledge of R programming, data analysis, and  statistical visualization using R packages such as ggplot2, which is "a plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics, which tries to take the good parts of base and lattice graphics and none of the bad parts. It...provid[es] a powerful model of graphics that makes it easy to produce complex multi-layered graphics." R is becoming a standard in statistics and data science, especially for those interested in reproducible research, transparency, and robustness. The student also will explore some discipline specific applications in GIS. 


**Course Objectives:**

The student will...

(1) learn more about creating and customizing a variety professional-quality data visualizations in R, using ggplot2 and other packages,
(2) create a portfolio of graphical examples in R Markdown that they can then use in future educational or professional settings, and
(3) explore more deeply the kinds of vusializations used in his major discipline, particularly GIS.

**Course Assessment & Grading:**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" (statistics and R) to effectively demonstrate your knowledge.  

*  60% of the course grade will come from the twelve textbook assignments (5% each)
*  20% of the course grade will come from the three "project" DataCamp modules (5% each)
     + Data Visualization in R with `ggvis`
     + Working with Geospatial Data in R
     + Interactive Maps with leaflet in R
     + Visualizing Time Series Data in R
*  20% of the course grade will come from the student-designed visualization project
     
This course uses the standard 10-point +/- grading scale (93--100 = A, 90--92 = A--, 87--89 = B+, etc.). All grades will be kept on [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/). You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they appear to be correct and complete. Feel free to inquire about your grades at any time.

The [Course Schedule](../CoursePacing/CoursePacingF2018.html) contains all assignments and due dates.


**Computers and Software**

This course will use the RStudio server  (https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/) that has the programs listed below (and more) installed. Note that all technology used in the class is either open source (free) or will be accessible to students enrolled in the course for no cost.

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org) 
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/starter)
* DataCamp (via [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/my/))

You must have an active internet connection and be registered in the course to access the server. To access the server, point any web browser to <https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/>.  You will need to acknowledge the connection is unsecure and possibly add a security exception to your web browser. Use your Appstate Username and Password to access the server.  A screen shot of the RStudio server is shown below. If you have problems with your Appstate Username or Password visit [IT Support Services](http://support.appstate.edu/) or call 262-6266.

**Expectations:**  

Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, students should spend about 1-3 hours on coursework outside class for every hour they spend in class. Since this is an independent study with limited face to face contact, a larger proportion of your work is self-paced outside class. You should anticipate spending 6-12 hours per week on work for this 3-credit course. If you are not comfortable or have not done well with quantitative courses in the past, you may need to spend more time. I am here to help you with this material and I want to see you succeed. I realize that many students work during the school year to finance their educations; however, that does not change the requirements of this course. Budget your time accordingly and pace yourself so that you can keep up and complete all your work on time. 


**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.


**University Policies**

This course conforms with all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance.  The details of the policies may be found at <http://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi>.
