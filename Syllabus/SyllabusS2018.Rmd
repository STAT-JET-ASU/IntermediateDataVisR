**Course Description:**  

Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. This course is an introduction to the basics of data management and visualization, including reproducible workflow. Topics include introductory concepts of programming and work flow, data manipulation, and data visualization using grammar of graphics. The course will also emphasize the practice of creating reproducible research using a version control system with dynamic document reporting, including tools such as R, R Studio, R Markdown, and Git. The overall goal of Data Science I is to help you learn some of the most important tools in R that will allow you to do data science.


**Course Objectives:**

1.	Students will learn to use a reproducible research work flow.
2.	Students will develop their data science technology expertise.
3.	Students will develop skills in programming, iteration, and sequencing.
4.	Students will learn how to read data in various formats and write to a file.
5.	Students will learn to manipulate, clean, code, and store data in a `tidy` format.
6.	Students will learn to visualize data and models using the grammar of graphics.
7.	Students will gain experience working with large data sets.
8.	Students will learn to display their work on the web.

**Course Assessment & Grading:**

The only way to learn statistics is to **DO** statistics, which includes statistical software. Reading the textbook, learning the language, and practicing exercises using real data are critical to your learning and success. Class activities and assessments have been structured with these principles in mind. It will be easier to participate if you acquire some familiarity with the vocabulary and methods before we start to discuss and use them. You must "speak the language" (statistics, R, and Git) to effectively demonstrate your knowledge.  

* 60% of the course grade will come from the thirteen DataCamp assignments

* 15% of the course grade will be for the design and creation of your web page 

* 25% of the course grade will come from the final project

Grades will be kept on AsULearn. You should monitor your grades throughout the term to make sure they appear to be correct and complete. Feel free to inquire about your grades at any time.       

The [CoursePacing guide](../CoursePacing/CoursePacingF2017.html) has all course assignments and due dates.

**Computers and Software**

This course will use the RStudio server  (https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/) that has the programs listed below (and more) installed. Note that all technology used in the class is either open source (free) or will be accessible to students enrolled in the course for no cost.

* [R](https://cran.r-project.org) 
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) 
* [GitHub](https://github.com)
* [LaTeX](https://www.ctan.org/starter)
* DataCamp (via [AsULearn](https://asulearn.appstate.edu/my/))

You must have an active internet connection and be registered in the course to access the server. To access the server, point any web browser to <https://mathr.math.appstate.edu/>.  You will need to acknowledge the connection is unsecure and possibly add a security exception to your web browser. Use your Appstate Username and Password to access the server.  A screen shot of the RStudio server is shown below. If you have problems with your Appstate Username or Password visit [IT Support Services](http://support.appstate.edu/) or call 262-6266.

**Expectations:**  

Prior to class, you should read the sections/pages listed in the reading assignment. To maximize your understanding of the class activities, you should take notes on the reading material prior to coming to class. To do well in the course, you **MUST** read the material prior to coming to class.  

If you have not read assigned materials and attempted assigned problems, you will likely be confused, feel lost, and have a terrible experience in this course. I DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN!  Appalachian students are expected to make intensive engagement with courses their first priority. Practically speaking, students should spend about 1-3 hours on coursework outside of class for every hour they spend in class. If you are not comfortable or have not done well with quantitative courses in the past, you may need to spend more than two hours preparing for each class meeting.  Please do yourself a favor and take this course only if you have enough time to devote to the course content. I am here to help you with this material, and I want to see you succeed. I realize that many students work during the school year to finance their educations; however, that does not change the requirements of this (or any) course.Budget your time accordingly and pace yourself so that you can keep up and complete all your work on time. 


**How To Get Unstuck**

Well constructed questions will elicit answers more rapidly than poorly constructed questions.  This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFaWxxzouCY&list=PLjTlxb-wKvXNSDfcKPFH2gzHGyjpeCZmJ&index=3) provides some background on asking questions.  This stackoverflow thread details how to create a [minimal R reproducible example](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610). Please read [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Raymond and Rick Moen and heed their advice.


**University Policies**

This course conforms with all Appalachian State University policies with respect to academic integrity, disability services, and class attendance.  The details of the policies may be found at <http://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi>.

As stated in the ASU Undergraduate Bulletin, students are expected to attend all course meetings and are completely responsible for their own attendance. Any student who is absent for any reason is completely responsible for all material covered in class. 

Every student should arrive to class on time and be prepared to participate at the beginning of class. They should not begin to pack up at the end of the period until the instructor is finished.  Any conduct that disrupts instruction (e.g., cell phone use, unnecessary chatter, computer use other than for class work) is disrespectful and disruptive both to other students and the instructor.  First offenses will be dealt with by the instructor.  Subsequent behavior issues will be referred to the [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentconduct.appstate.edu/).  As a courtesy to everyone, turn off cell phones and beepers during class.  Failure to do so may lead to confiscation or prohibition of such items for the duration of the course as per ASU policy.
